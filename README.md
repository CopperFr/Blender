# BlenderVxKex

Windows 7 CUDA & OptiX support for Blender 4.x and newer with [VxKex](https://github.com/CopperFr/VxKex).

## Description

This repository contains releases of files to replace in the official portable install
of Blender to have CUDA and/or OptiX cycles working when [VxKex](https://github.com/CopperFr/VxKex) is used.

Build environment:
```
Visual Studio 2019, version 16.11.46
Windows SDK 10.0.22000.0
NVIDIA CUDA 10.2 / 11.8 
NVIDIA OptiX 7.3
```
When you use [VxKex](https://github.com/CopperFr/VxKex) on the official portable install of Blender it will work but cycles
CUDA or OptiX will not. For CUDA you'll have an error:
**Failed to load CUDA kernel from '...\kernel_sm_XX.cubin.zst' (Invalid kernel image)**

It will work if you replace files from **blender-CUDA-OptiX-patch_4_x_x.zip** but you will still
need to use [VxKex](https://github.com/CopperFr/VxKex).

For CUDA you can only replace the file indicated in the error message.

For OptiX you need to replace other files and blender.exe because official one is checking for r495+ drivers to enable OptiX.  
(OptiX 7.4 requires that you install a r495+ driver not available in Windows 7)

**Support is only available for compute capability between 3.0 and 8.9.**

Render Image seems to have an issue with OptiX cycles when Open Shading Language is checked (preview is working correctly)
